## Middleware

### Timeout & Retry

### Rate Limiting & Flood Protection

also includes Bandwidth Budgeting (Set per-player or global limits and receive warnings when you exceed them.)

### AOI (Area‑of‑Interest) Filtering

### Client Prediction & Reconciliation (Rollback)

Let clients predict movement/animations locally and reconcile when the server corrects them.

### Codecs

Swap in JSON, MessagePack, Protobuf, or custom bit‑packed formats.

### OOP

Maybe also something that preserves the metatable index so u can literally pass in any OOP object with metatable and it will reconstruct on the other side

### Latency Simulation

Inject arbitrary delay, drop rates or jitter locally so you can test how clients cope under poor network conditions

### Profiler

Built‑In Profiler - Track round‑trip times, bandwidth per-remote, calls per-second, etc., surfaced in an in‑game debug UI.

### Interpolation
